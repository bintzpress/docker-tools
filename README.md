## About the Project

docker-build is a program used to pull, build, and push docker images using configuration files similar to docker-compose.yml files.

## Using the Project

The examples directory contains an example for a stack I use. It has docker-build-set.yml in the base which
tells where to find the docker-build.yml files. The program will then follow the directions in the 
docker-build.yml files. It understands dependencies and can do pull, build, and pushes. It can push to 
multiple repositories.
